# **Hi, welcome to my git repo.**


## Here I'll be consolidate my learnings and create a re-usable code base.
## If you find anything useful please feel free to use. Follow for more updates.


## LwcTrigger
- Since we can't intercept record trasaction in between to collect response or display UI using OOTB record details page.
- This is simple component based on getRecord wire adapter.
- It continueously tracks changes in mentioned fields on record detail page.
- ***LWC UI will be rendered post completion of transaction process***

**Use Case**
- Collect user responce right after record update from standard details page.
- Show some UI once record update is processed.
